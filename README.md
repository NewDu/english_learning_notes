### 语法
#### to which
the word to which the pronoun refers

to which 介词 + 关系词

refers 需要宾语，看到to which就表示前后要发生关系

介词的位置可以有二种，第一种为介词留在原处，定语从句由which引导。第二种是介词位于which之前。后者是正式语体形式。例如：

This is the book which he has talked about.

which引导定语从句，并在从句中作介词about的宾语，about which在从句作状语。介词about是动词talked要求的。这种介词留在原处的用法为非正式语体。

This is the book about which he has talked.

about which 引导定语从句，which在从句中作about的宾语，介词短语在从句中作状语。
